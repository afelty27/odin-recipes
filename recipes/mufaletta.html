        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees</li>
        <li>Cut the bread in half (horizontal cut) and scoop out some of the inside of each bread with a spoon (this is to 
            make room for the olive dressing without making it too sloppy!)
        </li>
        <li>Prepare the olive dressing. Mix together the green olives, black olives, parmesan cheese together
             in a bowl. Then, add 6oz italian dressing (or to taste)
        </li>
        <li>Evenly distribute the olive dressing into each of the divets that were created on the top and bottom
             half of the bread.
        </li>
        <li>Alternate layering each of the cheeses and meat onto the bread (half of each goes on each half of the bread)</li>
        <li>Leave the two halves of the bread separated. Put on cooking sheet and cook until thoroughly headed and cheese is melted</li>
        <li>Let cool until safe to eat, enjoy!</li>
